Welcome! I am currenly a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics surpervised by [Juhee Lee](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/juheelee/home?authuser=0) at University of California Santa Cruz (expected graduation 2024). Before joining UCSC, I completed my MS degree in Statistics at Duke University advised by [Surya T. Tokdar](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~st118/). I’m currently working on
- Bayesian high-dimensional modeling
- Multivariate count table with application to microbiome study and ecological study. 
- Bayesian density regression with discontinuity
