Welcome! I am currenly a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics surpervised by [Juhee Lee](https://sites.google.com/ucsc.edu/juheelee/home?authuser=0) at University of California Santa Cruz. Before joining UCSC, I completed my MS degree in Statistics at Duke University advised by [Surya T. Tokdar](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~st118/). I’m currently working on
- Bayesian high-dimensional modeling
- Multivariate count table with application to microbiome study and ecological study. 
- Bayesian density regression with discontinuity

## Publications

* **[Diagnostic Business Cycles](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/BIS.pdf) (with [Francesco Bianchi](https://sites.google.com/view/francescobianchi/home) and [Cosmin Ilut](https://sites.google.com/site/cosminilut/))**
  <br>
  Forthcoming, **Review of Economic Studies**.

  We develop theoretical and methodological framework to apply diagnostic expectations to a large class of recursive macro models, with a focus on implications of memory recall based on distant past. 
  
  ([Technical Appendix](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/BIS_appendix.pdf))

* **[Learning, Confidence, and Business Cycles](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/ilut_saijo.pdf) (with [Cosmin Ilut](https://sites.google.com/site/cosminilut/))**
  <br>
  **Journal of Monetary Economics**, 2021.
  
  We propose a new propagation mechanism based on firm-level confidence dynamics that challenges and improves upon standard New Keynesian frictions.
  
  ([Technical Appendix](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/ilut_saijo_appendix.pdf))
 
* **[Redistribution and Fiscal Uncertainty Shocks](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/policy_uncertainty.pdf)**
  <br>
  **International Economic Review**, 2020.
 
  The interaction of ambiguity aversion and limited capital market participation magnifies the impact of fiscal uncertainty shocks on economic activity because concerns about redistribution have first-order effects.
  
  ([Technical Appendix](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/policy_uncertainty_appendix.pdf))

* **[Technology Shocks and Hours Revisited: Evidence from Household Data](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/hours.pdf)**
  <br>
  **Review of Economic Dynamics**, 2019.
  
  Contrary to the aggregate evidence, labor supply responses to technology shocks at the household level indicate that the data is inconsistent with the sticky price view of the business cycle.
  
  ([Working paper version with additional results](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/hours_wp.pdf))
  
* **[The Uncertainty Multiplier and Business Cycles](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/uncertainty_multiplier.pdf)**
  <br>
  **Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control**, 2017.
  
  A dynamic general equilibrium model where agents learn about macro fundamentals through investment. The endogenously countercyclical uncertainty amplifies output fluctuations by 16%.
  
* **[Estimating DSGE Models Using Seasonally Adjusted and Unadjusted Data](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/seasonal_DSGE.pdf)**
  <br>
  **Journal of Econometrics**, 2013.
  
  The common practice of estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models using seasonally adjusted data leads to sizeable distortions in estimated parameters.
  
  ([Technical Appendix](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/seasonal_DSGE_appendix.pdf))
  
* **[The Japanese Depression in the Interwar Period: A General Equilibrium Analysis](http://hsaijo.github.io/files/japanese_depression.pdf)**
  <br>
  **The B.E. Journal of Macroeconomics: Topics**, 2008.
  
  The increase in markups due to cartelization can explain a substantial fraction of Japan's weak recovery from the Great Depression.
